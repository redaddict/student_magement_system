Title: Student Management System

Overview:
The Student Management System is a web-based application developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework, and SQLite, a lightweight relational database management system. This system provides an efficient platform for educational institutions to manage student information, academic records, administrative tasks, and communication between students, teachers, and administrators.

Key Features:

User Authentication: The system provides secure user authentication mechanisms for students, teachers, and administrators to access the platform with unique login credentials. This ensures data privacy and access control.

Student Profile Management: Students can create and manage their profiles, including personal details, contact information, academic records, attendance, and other relevant data. They can also upload documents like identification proofs, transcripts, or certificates.

Course Management: Administrators can define and manage courses offered by the institution, including details such as course name, description, duration, schedule, and associated faculty members.

Enrollment and Registration: Students can enroll in courses offered by the institution through the system. Administrators can manage the enrollment process, verify student registrations, and handle enrollment-related tasks.

Technology Stack:

Backend Framework: Django (Python)
Database Management System: SQLite
Frontend Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with frameworks like Bootstrap for responsive design)
Deployment: Django deployment options like Heroku, AWS, or self-hosting on a server
Benefits:
